D43/D44 — agent access. New package `@handamade/psi-mcp`: an MCP server (stdio via
`npx @handamade/psi-mcp`, hosted Streamable HTTP at https://psi.kurkin.de/mcp) with two
read-only tools — `search` (briefs over components/tokens/guidance) and `get` (full props,
token formulas with resolved values in all four themes, topics) — answering from an index
baked at publish from the generated artifacts. `npx @handamade/psi-mcp init [--claude]`
generates a marker-delimited agent guide (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) from the same index.
tokens/react bump in lockstep; no API changes in either.
